A) the purpose of this repo is to take a CSV file and put it into a database.

b) I but the entire CSV file into the database, then i removed the bad collums, then i put the bad coolems into a CSV file.
the i exported the log file.

c) I have never worked with any of this before so i used openCSV in Mavel then i got a CSV reader (open Source) to read in the
CSV file.

note: I know that this doen't work but i can't figure the project out. i did a lot of reserch and I did what i could. Plaese
consider me for a face-to-face interview. I am a fast learner and will take to the training course fast.

thanks,
